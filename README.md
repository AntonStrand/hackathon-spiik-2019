# hackathon-spiik-2019
Our project for SPIIK hackathon 2019 at Meridium.

## Theme
The theme of the hackathon is "social benefit".

## Our project
Help children learn the value of money.

## Ideas
The idea is to have an application that a parent/s can use with their kids to learn the
value of money in an otherwise cash-free society.

Example flow:
A family is going to the supermarket and their child, lets call her Emma, wants to use some of their savings to buy candy for the weekend.
So before leaving, the parent logs in to the application and opens Emmas "digital wallet".
This will render a screen where the total amount of saving is shown in one box with different currency values and another empty box(Amount to spend).), Emma will now have to move the different currency values from her savings to the spending box and see how the coins and bills gets removed from her savings, giving her a smaller amount of savings.

This will bring a more aware approach to spending money by visually presenting bills and coins instead of watching a plastic card pay for everything.
